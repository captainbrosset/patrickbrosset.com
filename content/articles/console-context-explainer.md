excerpt: "What if there was a way to make console logs in DevTools stand out more, be easier to find, and easier to filter? On the Edge team, we're proposing to use the <code>console.context()</code> API to add badges to log messages from different parts of your codebase, and to make it easier to filter them in the console."
