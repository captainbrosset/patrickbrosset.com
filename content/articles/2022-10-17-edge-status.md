Why doesn't Edge have a platform status page?

1. Used to have one, still online here: but was relevant in spartan days. Not up to date anymore.
1. Now on chromium, contributing to the chromium platform directly. So chromestatus.com
1. chromestatus.com is, unfortunately branded chrome, but really contains stuff from all contributors to the project.
1. Generally, the roadmap will match Edge too. We have the same version numbers, and ship at the same frequency. Sometimes our releases will have a few days of delay.
1. A way to find what MS is working on is to filter by email addresses.
