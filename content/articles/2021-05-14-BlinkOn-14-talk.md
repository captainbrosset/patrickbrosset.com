## BlinkOn 14 Talk - Flexbox and Grid Tooling in Chromium

<time datetime="2021-05-14">May 14th, 2021</time>

Last year, a crew of engineers, designers and PMs got together across Microsoft and Google, and we worked together on adding tooing dedicated to CSS Grid and Flexbox.

These are 2 of the most used layout techniques in CSS, and we wanted all web developers using Chromium-based browsers to have the tools they need to debug problems and understand how these techniques work.

This week, for [BlinkOn 14](https://www.chromium.org/events/blinkon-14), I gave a short talk about why we implemented those tools, the features they have, and how we implemented them.

Here's the talk, hope you like it!
