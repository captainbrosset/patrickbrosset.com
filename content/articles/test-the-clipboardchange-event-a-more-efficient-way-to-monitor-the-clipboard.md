excerpt: "The Edge web platform team is adding a new event to the Clipboard API: `clipboardchange`. This new event makes it much easier to react to changes in the system clipboard without having to read the content in a loop. This is more efficient and better for privacy. Interested? Test the event in Chromium-based browsers today, including via an origin trial, and let us know what you think."
