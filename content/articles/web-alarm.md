what happens if you leave it running in the background?

pwa background processing.
what happens when you leave a timer running in a background thread. will it show the correct time when you come back to the app?
what happens when the user moves focus away from app.


front-end code? does it get frozen? Is the state preserved when you unfreeze it?
service worker? can you keep it alive? can you wake it up? how often?
