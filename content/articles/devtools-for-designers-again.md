I wrote a couple of weeks ago about [how browser devtools should be thinking about addressing the needs of designers](2015-02-12-devtools-for-creative-people) and it looks like that post was right on time!

Indeed, it seems that the ChromeDevTools team is starting to invest in this area more and more. This is brilliant!

And on [this trello page](https://trello.com/b/GKotpgkR/devtools-for-designers) the ChromeDevTools team is looking for people to submit and comment on ideas on this area.

Here are some screenshots from that page:

Knowing that on the Firefox side, weâ€™ve set ourselves goals to ship creative tools this year too, designers who work for the web should be in a better place really soon!
