excerpt: "The web platform has been missing an imperative way to notify users of assistive technologies about important changes to a webpage that are not otherwise announced, such as those that do not cause a DOM or focus change. We've designed the Aria Notify API to fill that gap and we'd love for you to try it out and let us know what you think."
