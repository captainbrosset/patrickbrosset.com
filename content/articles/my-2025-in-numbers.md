Today is the last day of 2025, which seems like a good time to look back and think about what I've done this year.
This year, more than ever, I've continued to push for a web that's easier to build with, more capable, easier to discover, and better documented.
I'm thankful to be able to do this work, something I enjoy and care deeply about.

But also in person, by giving 4 talks:

* 2 lightning talks at Smashing Conf events:
  
  * [Masonry - The pretty grid you didn’t see coming (Smashing Conference, NYC, October 2025)](/slides/2025-10-CSS-Masonry.pdf)

  * [web-features and Baseline - We're feature complete! What's next? (W3C Breakouts Day)](/slides/breakouts-day-2025/)

## I demonstrated what the web is capable of

* I built 15 little experiments on my site, here are those which I'm most proud of/are the most useful:

  * [Navigating the web platform](/lab/navigating-the-web-platform)
  * [CSS gap decoration resources](/lab/css-gap-decoration-resources)
  * [CSS Masonry resources](/lab/css-masonry-resources)
  * [Web features finder](/lab/web-features-finder)
  * [Implementing an accordion component in 2026 🪗](/lab/accordion)

* I built 15 demos on [the Edge Demos repo](https://github.com/microsoftEdge/Demos), supporting the web platform docs my team maintains.

## I documented web technologies and made them easier to find and use

* I created over 180 commits to [the web-features repository](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features), to help build a better, more comprehensive, catalog of all the features of the web platform.

* I created about 10 commits to the [mdn/content](https://github.com/mdn/content) and [mdn/browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/) repositories, to improve MDN web docs and browser compatibility tables.

* I created over 140 commits to the [MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/edge-developer), to improve the [web platform-related Edge technical documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/developer/), in particular publishing [Edge Beta release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/web-platform/release-notes/) every 4 weeks.

* I created about 200 commits both on the [web-features-mappings](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features-mappings) and [web-features-explorer](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features-explorer) repos, which together power [the Web Platform Features Explorer site](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/), a tool to discover and learn about the web platform, via [monthly release notes](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/release-notes/december-2025/), and [detailed feature pages](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/features/document-caretpositionfrompoint/).

## I contributed to open source

* GitHub tells me that I've made [3187 contributions this year](https://github.com/captainbrosset/).

* I've also opened about 260 issues and pull requests.

## On the personal side

Because work is only a part of life, and can never be more important than your own well-being and loved ones:

* I biked, ran, hiked, and skied over 1400km, totaling 32000m of elevation gain (and that's not counting the multiple sessions I do at the bouldering gym each week).

* I listened to more than 55,000 minutes of music.

* I took more than 5000 photos, some of which you've seen in this blog.

Happy new year folks, see you in 2026!
