excerpt: "Fran√ßois Daoust and I tell the story of how the WebDX Community Group has now completed the first catalog of web features, mapping more than 1000 higher-level web developer features to low-level @mdn/browser-compat-data entries. This catalog helps developers track feature availability across browsers and is available via the web-features package on npm, as well as displayed as Baseline banners in various websites and tools."
