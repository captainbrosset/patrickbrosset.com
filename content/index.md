## Hey, I'm Patrick

I am a PM on the Edge Developer Experience team at Microsoft, and previously worked at Mozilla.\
I have about 20 years of experience with web technologies, and have been working on browsers for the past 10 years. I like <a href="lab">creating</a> web things and sometimes <a href="articles">write</a> and <a href="talks">talk</a> about those things.
