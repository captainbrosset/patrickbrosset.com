          I was in charge of the engineering team that implemented and
          maintained the following tools in Firefox: CSS grid inspector, Flexbox
          inspector, Fonts editor, CSS Shapes editor, CSS Changes tracker, the
          Responsive Design Mode and more.<br />
          These are industry-leading tools that have been acclaimed by DevTools
          users, and have been influencing other browser vendors' strategies.<br />
          The biggest part of my job consisted in managing engineers, including
          hiring, mentoring, planning, setting goals and expectations, doing
          performance reviews, etc.<br />
          I was also actively involved in defining the product strategy, setting
          team goals and helping design and ship new features, keeping in close
          contact with product management and user experience.<br />
          I was also the owner of the DevTools module within

          At first I managed a sub-team within DevTools, but then moved on to
          being in charge of the entire group (~20 people, including two
          managers and their teams).<br />
          My responsibilities included people management, hiring, planning,
          defining strategies and goals and technical ownership of the Inspector
          module.<br />
          I led the team through various projects including: the first CSS
          layout debugging tool in any browser (CSS Grid inspector, which I
          actively helped design, implement and ship), important re-architecture
          projects (XUL removal, and multi-process support), refactor of the
          entire UI with React/Redux, new remote debugging features, etc.

          I was in charge of the DOM/HTML/CSS tooling within DevTools.<br />
          My main work consisted in setting the Inspector tool on a trajectory
          that would make it relevant and even possibly leading in the
          future.<br />
          I implemented a lot of missing features then, modernized it, but also
          implemented innovative features (a CSS animation/transition inspector,
          a CSS transform previewer). Finally, I participated in many code
          clean-up and re-architecture projects such as the implementation of an
          entire new rendering stack for highlighting elements in the page.
