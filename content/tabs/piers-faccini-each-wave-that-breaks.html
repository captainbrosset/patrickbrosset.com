<p>Capo seconde barrette</p>

C               Em
Somewhere else a river runs

Am(7)           F           G
Somewhere else the rain is gone

C           Em
Oh I leap, I tumble and fall

Am(7)                F       G
And I won’t keep and lose it all

F             G          Em        Am(7)
And the ocean knows each wave that breaks

C         Em     Am(7)  
Is coming home

C         Em      F(7)
Is coming home

C              Em
Somewhere else a rose will grow

Am(7)           F           G
Somewhere else a time to sow

C         Em
Oh I pray that I wont miss

Am(7)             F        G
Oh how I ache for one last kiss

F             G          Em        Am(7)
And the ocean knows each wave that breaks

C         Em     Am(7)
Is coming home

C         Em      F(7)
Is coming home


No way there, no way home


No way back, I’m going home


No way there, no way home


No way back, I’m going home
