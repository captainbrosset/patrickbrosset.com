C
I've been down and I'm wondering why

Am
These little black clouds keep walking around

Em       Dsus2
With me, with me

C
It wastes time and I'd rather be high

Am
Think I'll walk me outside and buy a rainbow smile

Em           Dsus2
But be free, they're all free

C             Am
 So maybe tomorrow

              Em  Dsus2
 I'll find my way home

C             Am
 So maybe tomorrow

              Em  Dsus2
 I'll find my way home

C
I look around at a beautiful life

Am
Been the upperside of down, been the inside of out

Em              Dsus2
But we breathe, we breathe

C
I wanna breeze and an open mind

Am
I wanna swim in the ocean, wanna take my time

Em      Dsus2
for me, All me

C             Am
 So maybe tomorrow

              Em  Dsus2
 I'll find my way home

C             Am
 So maybe tomorrow

              Em  Dsus2
 I'll find my way home

C   Am  Em  Dsus2
[Solo]

C             Am
 So maybe tomorrow

              Em  Dsus2
 I'll find my way home

C             Am
 So maybe tomorrow

              Em  Dsus2
 I'll find my way home

Am            B
Aaaaaaaaaaa...aaaa (x2)

      Em            Dsus2
My My My...   My My My...

C  Am  Em  Dsus2
[Outro]
