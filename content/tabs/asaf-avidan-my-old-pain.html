I'm in love again

        Am
With my old pain

With my old pain

C       Am       C
Save me from the same

Perpetual game

      F
Of my own name

C              G              Am            F
Every time the Weeping Willow dances in the breeze

C             G                Am         G
Please remind everybody that I smile with ease

        F     G
Not too long ago

          Am    C   F
So honey, don't let go (ooh)

   Am   C   F       G
Of what you know of me (ooh)

[Verse 2]

C    Am         C
I am dressed to kill

      Am
In my old skin

      F
In my old skin

C       Am       G
Save me from the same

           Am
Primordial sin

       F
That's deep within

C              G                  Am             F
Every time I'm hungry, waves come dancing in the sand

C                  G               Am           G
Please remind this broken shell it used to be a man

        F    G
Not too long ago

          Am    C   F
So honey, don't let go (ooh)

   Am   C   F       G
Of what you know of me (ooh) 

     F           G             C            F
Take heed of the ocean and the scent of the storm

    Am           G             F             G
And whisper the West Wind and guide me back home
