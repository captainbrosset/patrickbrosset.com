F  Dm  Am  G
[Intro]

F  Dm


Am
I didn't want to be the one to forget

G
I thought of everything I'd never regret

F
A little time with you is all that I get

Dm
That's all we need because it's all we can take

Am
One thing I never see the same when you're 'round

G
I don't believe in him, his lips on the ground.

F
I want to take you to that place in the Roche

Dm
But no one gives us any time anymore

Am
He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog

G
You made an offer for it, then you ran off

F
I got a picture of us kids in my head

Dm
And all I hear is the last thing that you said:

Am
"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"

         G
I didn't want to anymore

Am                          F
And we will never be alone again

                             Dm
Cause it doesn't happen everyday

                             G
Kinda counted on you being a friend

                             Am
Can I give it up or give it away

                                 F
Now I thought about what I wanna say

                                 Dm
But I never really know where to go

                         G
So I chained myself to a friend

                                Am
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

                            F
And we will never be alone again

                             Dm
Cause it doesn't happen everyday

                             G
Kinda counted on you being a friend

                             Am
Can I give it up or give it away

                                 F
Now I thought about what I wanna say

                                 Dm
But I never really know where to go

                         G
So I chained myself to a friend

     F             Dm
Some more again

Am
It didn't matter what they wanted to see

G
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me

F
The summer memory that just never dies

Dm
We worked too long and hard to give it no time

Am
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies

G
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise

F
He runs the scissor at the seam in the wall

Dm
He cannot break it down or else he would fall

Am
1000 lonely stars

G
Hiding in the cold

F                         Dm
Take it, oh I don't wanna sing anymore

Am  G  F  Dm
[Instrumental]

Am
"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"

G
I didn't want to anymore

Am                          F
And we will never be alone again

                             Dm
Cause it doesn't happen everyday

                             G
Kinda counted on you being a friend

                             Am

                                 F

                                 Dm

Am              F
(I) don't understand, 

            Dm
don't get upset,

             G
I'm not with you.

Am              F
We're swimming around,

           Dm               G
It's all I do when I'm with you

Am                          F
And we will never be alone again

                             Dm
Cause it doesn't happen everyday

                             G
