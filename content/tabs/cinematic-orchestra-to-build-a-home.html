[Intro]

D             A              E
   There is a house built out of stone

D             A                E
   Wooden floors, walls and window sills...

D                 A             E
   Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust...

Bm            Dadd9                 A          E
   This is a place where I don't feel alone

Bm               Dadd9             A       E
   This is a place where I feel at home...

D Amaj7 D A E
[interlude]

     D Amaj7     D        A         E
And, I built a home  for you    for me

   D      Amaj7   D        A           E
Until it disappeared from me    from you        

     D        Amaj7   D F#m     A       E
And now, it's time to live and turn to dust........

[Interlude]

D            A                E
Out in the garden where we planted the seeds

Bm           D      A      E
There is a tree as old as me

D               A          E
Branches were sewn by the color of green

Bm           Dadd9          A            E
Ground had arose and passed it's knees

       D             A          E
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top

Bm             Dadd9       A      E
I climbed the tree to see the world

         D            A         E
When the gusts came around to blow me down

Bm              Dadd9            A        E
I held on as tightly as you held onto me

Bm              Dadd9            A        E
I held on as tightly as you held onto me......

D Amaj7 D A E
[interlude]

     D Amaj7     D        A         E
And, I built a home  for you    for me

   D      Amaj7   D        A           E
Until it disappeared from me    from you        

    D         Amaj7   D F#m     A       E
And now, it's time to live and turn to dust........
