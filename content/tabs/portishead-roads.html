Am     G6              Fma7  E7               Am
  Oho,   can't anybody see?       We've got a war to fight,

G6                     Fmaj7       E7
  Never found our way,  regardless,  of what they say

F                G       Am                F
   How can it feel, this wrong?  From this moment,

            G          Am
How can if feel, this wrong?

Am        G6                  Fmaj7      E7      Am

        G6  Fmaj7    E7           F                G
Can I say,    frozen,   to myself, I got nobody on my side,

                      Am
And surely that ain't right

F       G                    Am
           Surely that ain't right.

Am     G6              Fma7  E7               Am
  Oho,   can't anybody see?       We've got a war to fight,

How can it feel, this wrong?
