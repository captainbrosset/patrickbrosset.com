Am              F


Am              F


Am              F


Am               F
Night songs are lonelier

Am                  F
Soundwaves fell the emptiness
 
Am                           F
       Live for a day in the light

                              Am
Conal streams are filling my eyes

                                F
   Never mind such slide of decay

                               C
And the flesh that only try to erase

                             F
Bright lights are filling me

                                Am
Bright lights are driving me deep

                             G         G
Bright lights surrounding me
 
Am           F
Shadows are leaving me

Am           F
Unhitch the beautiful 
 
Am                                F
        I wanna see how far we go out

                          Am
  I wanna hold you dearly 

                                       F
And there's a breeze that's keeping me still

                                   C
There's a wound that's keeping you here 

                            F
Bright lights are killing me

                               Am
Bright lights are pulling me in

                              G
Bright lights are flooding me 

C                            F
Bright lights are filling me

                                 Am
Bright lights are driving me deep

                             G
Bright lights surrounding me

 
Em                Dm


Am                G


Am                F


Am                F
