Bm        A       G
I can fly

       F#m
but I want his wings

Bm        A       G
I can shine even in the darkness

       F#m
but I crave the light that he brings

Bm        A       G
revel in the songs that he sings

       F#m
my angel gabriel

Bm        A       G
I can love

       F#m
but I need his heart

Bm        A       G
I am strong even on my own

       F#m
but from him I never want to part

Bm        A       G
he's been there since the very start

       F#m
my angel gabriel

Bm        A       G       F#m
my angel gabriel

Bm        A       G       F#m
bless the day he came to be

Bm        A       G
angel's wings carried him to me

       F#m
heavenly

Bm        A       G
I can fly

       F#m
but I want his wings

Bm        A       G
I can shine even in the darkness

       F#m
but I crave the light that he brings

Bm        A       G
revel in the songs that he sings

       F#m
my angel gabriel
