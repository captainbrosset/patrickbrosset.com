[Intro]

        F#m                     C#m/E
I see the marbles in the garden

        Dmaj7           C#7
Have a sadness in their eyes

        F#m                     C#m/E
And all the birds retuned to silence

        Dmaj7           C#7
In our lonesome paradise

        F#m                     C#m/E
'Cause I got madness in my arms

        Dmaj7           C#7
But you're my lucky charm

        F#m                     C#m/E
When all the birds return to silence

        Dmaj7           C#7     F#m
Get some sleep and I'll be fine

Bm
You know our Babylon will fall

        F#m/A
When dreams will turn to dust

        C#/G#           C#7     F#m
Will you believe in us?

                Bm
You know our Babylon will fall

        F#m/A
When dust turns into time

        C#/G#           C#7
Our water turns to wine

        F#m             C#m/E
We are dancing on the tables

        Dmaj7           C#7
We are lovers taking baths

        F#m             C#m/E
We're the royals in a fable

        Dmaj7                   C#7
And the neighbours make us laugh

        F#m             C#m/E
And everything that I adore

        Dmaj7           C#7
Just mattress on the floor

                F#m             C#m/E
When all the birds return to silence

        Dmaj7                   C#7     F#m
Get some sleep and I'll be fine

Bm
You know our Babylon will fall

        F#m/A
When dreams will turn to dust

        C#/G#           C#7     F#m
Will you believe in us?

                Bm
You know our Babylon will fall

        F#m/A
When dust turns into time

        C#/G#           C#7
Our water turns to wine

F#m     C#m/E   Dmaj7   C#7


F#m     C#m/E   Dmaj7   C#7


F#m


Bm
You know our Babylon will fall

        F#m/A
When dreams will turn to dust

        C#/G#           C#7     F#m
Will you believe in us?

                Bm
You know our Babylon will fall

        F#m/A
When dust turns into time

        C#/G#           C#7
Our water turns to wine

        Bm
And I will make you mine

        F#m
Againâ€¦
