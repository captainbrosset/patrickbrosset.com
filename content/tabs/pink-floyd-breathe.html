[Intro]

Cmaj7


Bm7


Fmaj7


G  D7#9 D7b9


Em                      A7
Breathe, breathe in the air

Em                 A7
Don't be afraid to care

Em                 A7
Leave, don't leave me

Em                          A7
Look around and choose your own ground

Cmaj7
Long you live and high you fly

Bm7
Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry

Fmaj7
all you touch and all you see

G                     D7#9 D7b9
Is all your life will ever be

Em          A7
Run, rabbit run

Em                        A7
Dig that hole, forget the sun

Em                           A7
And when at last the work is done

Em                               A7
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

Cmaj7
For long you live and high you fly

Bm7
But only if you ride the tide

Fmaj7
And balanced on the biggest wave

G                   D7#9  D7b9
You race towards an early grave
