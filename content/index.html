<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>My name is Patrick Brosset. I'm a product manager on the Edge team at Microsoft, where I work on a range of technologies such as the Web platform, Progressive Web Apps, and DevTools. Previously, I worked at Mozilla, on the Firefox DevTools team.<br>
I'm also on the governing committee of <a href="https://openwebdocs.org/">Open Web Docs</a> and I co-chair the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/">W3C WebDX community group</a>.</p>

<p>I have more than twenty years of working experience with the web, having worked both as a web developer and a browser engineer and PM.</p>

<p>On this website, I <a href="articles">write</a> and <a href="talks">talk</a> about the web, and what it can do for developers. I also sometimes <a href="lab">create</a> little experiments and tools.</p>

<p>To connect with me, use the links to my social networks at the bottom of this page. You can also email me: patrickbrosset <em>at</em> gmail <em>dot</em> com.</p>
