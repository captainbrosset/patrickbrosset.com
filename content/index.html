<h2>Hey there <img class="icon" src="/assets/wave.png" alt="A waving hand"></h2>

<p>My name is Patrick Brosset. I'm a senior product manager on the Edge team at Microsoft, where I work on a range of technologies such as the Web platform, Progressive Web Apps, and DevTools. Previously, I worked at Mozilla, on the Firefox DevTools team.<br>
I'm also on the governing committee of <a href="https://openwebdocs.org/">Open Web Docs</a> and one of the co-chairs of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/">W3C WebDX community group</a>.</p>

<p>I have about twenty years of experience with web technologies, and have been working on browsers for the past ten years.</p>

<p>On this website, I like <a href="articles">writing</a> and <a href="talks">talking</a> about the web, and what it can do for developers. I also sometimes <a href="lab">create</a> little experiments with web technologies.</p>
