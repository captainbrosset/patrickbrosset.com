<h2>Hey, I'm Patrick</h2>

<p>I am a PM on the Edge Developer Experience team at Microsoft, and previously worked at Mozilla.<br>
I have about 20 years of experience with web technologies, and have been working on browsers for the past 10 years.
I like <a href="lab">creating</a> web things and sometimes <a href="articles">write</a> and <a href="talks">talk</a> about those things.</p>

<h3>Latest articles</h3>

<ul class="entries">
  {% set count = 0 %}
  {% for post in collections.article | reverse %}
    {% if count < 4 %}
      {% if not post.data.draft %}
        {% include "one-article-in-loop.njk" %}
        {% set count = count + 1 %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
